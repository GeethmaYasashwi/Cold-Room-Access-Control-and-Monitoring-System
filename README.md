# Cold-Room-Access-Control-and-Monitoring-System

# Introduction

Cold rooms are essential in industries related to food, pharmaceuticals, and research, but they also pose a lot of safety and security risks. Our system addresses these concerns by using face recognition for access control, and issuing alerts for prolonged stays. It enhances safety, prevents incidents, and maintains accountability.
