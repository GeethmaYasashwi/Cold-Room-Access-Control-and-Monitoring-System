# Cold-Room-Access-Control-and-Monitoring-System

# Introduction

Cold rooms are essential in industries related to food, pharmaceuticals, and research, but they also pose a lot of safety and security risks. Our system addresses these concerns by using face recognition for access control, and issuing alerts for prolonged stays. It enhances safety, prevents incidents, and maintains accountability.

# Components: 
o	ESP32 Microcontroller: Core processing and control unit.
o	Camera Module (OV2640): Captures images for face recognition.
o	Servo Motor: Controls the automatic door system.
o	DHT22 Sensor: Monitors temperature and humidity inside the cold room.
o	Power Supply Unit: Ensures stable operation.
o	7805 Regulator: Provides a stable 5V output for components.
o	Relay Module: Controls high-power devices such as the door motor.
o	UART TTL Programmer: Facilitates programming and debugging of the ESP32 microcontroller.

# System Architecture


The system integrates hardware and software components to control access and monitor activity in the cold room. 
Face Recognition Module: Identifies and verifies authorized personnel. 
Door Control Mechanism: Actuates automatic door opening/closing. 
Timer and Alert System: Tracks the time spent by individuals and issues alerts if the allowed time is exceeded. 
Logbook Module: Logs employee ID, entry time, and exit time in a database.
