# Cold-Room-Access-Control-and-Monitoring-System

# Introduction

Cold rooms are essential in industries related to food, pharmaceuticals, and research, but they also pose a lot of safety and security risks. Our system addresses these concerns by using face recognition for access control, and issuing alerts for prolonged stays. It enhances safety, prevents incidents, and maintains accountability.

# Components: 
o	ESP32 Microcontroller: Core processing and control unit.
o	Camera Module (OV2640): Captures images for face recognition.
o	Servo Motor: Controls the automatic door system.
o	DHT22 Sensor: Monitors temperature and humidity inside the cold room.
o	Power Supply Unit: Ensures stable operation.
o	7805 Regulator: Provides a stable 5V output for components.
o	Relay Module: Controls high-power devices such as the door motor.
o	UART TTL Programmer: Facilitates programming and debugging of the ESP32 microcontroller.
